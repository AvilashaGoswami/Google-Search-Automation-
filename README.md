#Google Search Automation
This is an automated search program that displays the top Google search results for a user-provided query. This python program utilizes the Selenium WebDriver module allowing user to automate web browsing. The path to the latest version of Windows ChromeDriver file from the device has been specifed in the code. Upon running, the user is prompted to enter a search topic. The program then opens the Google homepage, sends the user's query to the searchbox, extracts the top search results and prints the first 5 results to the console.
